# hello-world

Hi there, my name is Cora Ryan. I am a software engineering professional. Following a sabbatical from full time IT work, in an entrepreneurial position, I am now returning with energy and enthusiasm to contribute and improve my software engineering capabilities.
I have experience of working on software products and projects, both in-house and also in a consultancy capacity, in the financial, telecoms, data-archiving and health and leisure industries.
I possess good attention to detail, strong analytical skills and have the ability to look at problems from a variety of angles. I also have a very good understanding of people and therefore clients and client requirements. I feel I am in a good position to develop and contribute to high quality software solutions.
I am looking for an interesting role working with current technologies which will challenge me as well as allowing me to add value using my existing skills and capabilities.
